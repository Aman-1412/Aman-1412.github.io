## What ?

It's so annoying that Valorant doesn't have all the details about an ability listed in the Agent Abilities page. They do not even maintain a 'reference' page, so to say. I couldn't find an updated collection of the time/duration for all the agent abilites - neither official nor a community one. So here's one by me.
